## Coordinate Reference Systems

A data structure cannot be considered geospatial unless it is
accompanied by coordinate reference system (CRS) information, in
a format that geospatial applications can use to display and
manipulate the data correctly. CRS information connects data to the
Earth's surface using a mathematical model.

> ## CRS vs SRS

> 'CRS' ('coordinate reference system') and 'SRS' ('spatial reference system') are synonyms and are commonly interchanged.

The Coordinate Reference System or CRS tells your mapping software (for example R)
where the raster is located
in geographic space. It also tells the mapping software what method should be used to "flatten"
or project the raster in geographic space.

Maps of the United States in different projections. Notice the
differences in shape associated with each different projection. These
differences are a direct result of the calculations used to "flatten" the
data onto a 2-dimensional map. Source: opennews.org

### What Makes Spatial Data Line Up On A Map?
There are lots of great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and
projections in greater detail (read more, below). For the purposes of this
activity, what is important to understand is that data from the same location
but saved in **different projections will not line up in any GIS or other
program**. Thus, it's important when working with spatial data in a program like
R to identify the coordinate reference system applied to the data and retain
it throughout data processing and analysis.

CRS information has three components:

CRS = Datum + Projection + Additional Parameters

A common analogy employed to teach projections is the orange peel analogy. If you imagine that the earth is an orange, how you peel it and then flatten the peel is similar to how projections get made. We will also use it here.  

### Datum  

A Datum is a model of the shape of the earth. It has angular units (i.e. degrees) and
defines the starting point (i.e. where is (0,0)?) so the angles reference a
meaningful spot on the earth. Common global datums are WGS84 and NAD83. Datums can
also be local - fit to a particular area of the globe, but ill-fitting outside the
area of intended use. When datums are used by themselves they are called a Geographic Coordinate
System.  

> ## Orange Peel Analogy

### Projection  

A Projection is a mathematical transformation of the angular measurements on a round earth to a
flat surface (i.e. paper or a computer screen). The units associated with a given projection are
usually linear (feet, meters, etc.). Many people use the term "projection" when they actually mean
"coordinate reference system".

### Additional Parameters  

Additional parameters are often necessary to create the full coordinate reference system. For
example, one common additional parameter is a definition of the center of the map. The number of
required additional parameters depends on what is needed by each specific projection.  

> ## Orange Peel Analogy
> An additional parameter could include a definition of the location of the stem of the fruit. What other parameters could be included in this analogy?
{: .discussion}


### Which CRS/projection should I use?

To decide if a projection is right for your data, answer these questions:  

  *  What is the area of minimal distortion?  
  *  What aspect of the data does it preserve?  

[University of Colorado's Map Projections](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html) and the [Department of Geo-Information Processing](http://kartoweb.itc.nl/geometrics/map%20projections/mappro.html) has a good discussion of these aspects of projections. Online tools like [Projection Wizard](http://projectionwizard.org/) can also help you discover projections that might be a good fit for your data.

### Describing Coordinate Reference Systems  

There are several common systems in use for storing and transmitting CRS information, as well as
translating among different CRSs. These systems generally comply with ISO 19111. EPSG, PROJ, and
OGC WKT are the most common. They aren't usually used on their own, but are built in to geospatial
software. The data we will be working with in this workshop use the `PROJ` system. 

#### PROJ

[PROJ](http://proj4.org/) is an open-source library for storing, representing and transforming CRS information. PROJ.5 has been recently released, but PROJ.4 was in use for 25 years so you will still mostly see PROJ referred to as PROJ.4. 

PROJ represents CRS information as a text string of key-value pairs, which makes it easy to customise (and with a little practice, easy to read and interpret). 

> ## Other Common Systems
> #### EPSG  
> 
> The [EPSG system](http://www.epsg.org) is a database of CRS information maintained by the
> International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. The dataset contains both CRS definitions and
> information on how to safely convert data from one CRS to another. Using EPSG is easy as every
> CRS has a integer identifier, e.g. WGS84 is EPSG:4326. The downside is that you can only use the
> CRSs EPSG defines and cannot customise them.  
> 
> Detailed information on the structure of the EPSG dataset is 
> [available on their website](http://www.epsg.org/GuidanceNotes).
> 
> #### OGC Well-known text (WKT)
> 
> The OGC WKT standard is used by a number of important geospatial apps and software libraries. 
> WKT is a nested list of geodetic parameters. The structure of the information is 
> [defined on their website](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wkt-crs). WKT is valuable in
> that the CRS information is more transparent than in EPSG, but can be more difficult to read and
> compare than PROJ. Additionally, the WKT standard is implemented inconsistently across various
> software platforms, and the spec itself has 
> [some known issues](http://gdal.org/wktproblems.html)).

#### Translating among CRS systems

CRS information can generally be translated between EPSG, PROJ and WKT representations without too
much trouble, but some mistranslations are possible, especially with obscure projections. For
convenience, the website [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/) holds descriptions of
many common projections data in several formats. Users should that the site does not appear to be
actively maintained at present, with the last update made in 2013. The GDAL library (more on this
in Lesson 3) has a function called [gdalsrsinfo](http://www.gdal.org/gdalsrsinfo.html) that will
report a file's CRS information in the format of your choice.

## Metadata  

Spatial data is useless without metadata. Essential metadata is, of course, the CRS information,
but proper spatial metadata encompasses more than that. History and provenance of a dataset (how i
was made), who is in charge of maintaining it, and appropriate (and inappropriate!) use cases
should also be documented in metadata. This information should accompany a spatial dataset wherever
it goes. In practice this can be difficult, as many spatial data formats don't have a built-in
place to hold this kind of information. Metadata often has to be stored in a companion file,
generated and maintained manually. 

### Format interoperability  

Many existing file formats were invented by GIS software developers, often in a closed-source
environment. This led to the large number of formats on offer today, and considerable problems
transferring data between software environments. Some companies have built their own file
translation capabilities into their software, but maintaining this capability takes a lot of work.
The [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library](http://www.gdal.org/) (GDAL) is an open-source answer to
this issue. 

GDAL is a set of software tools that translate between almost any geospatial format in common use
today (and some not so common ones). GDAL also contains tools for editing and manipulating both
raster and vector files, including reprojecting data to different CRSs. GDAL can be used as a
standalone command-line tool, or built in to other GIS software. Several open-source GIS programs
use GDAL for all file import/export operations.
