## About Vector Data

Vector data structures represent specific features on the Earth's
surface, and
assign attributes to those features. Vectors are composed of discrete
geometric locations (x, y
values) known as
vertices that define the shape of the spatial object. The organization
of the vertices determines the type of vector that we are working
with: point, line or polygon.

* **Points:** Each point is defined by a single x, y coordinate.
There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include:
sampling locations, the location of individual trees, or the location of
survey plots.

* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) points that
are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a
line. This
line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or
stream
represents a vertex that has defined x, y location.

* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are 
connected and closed. The outlines of survey plot boundaries, lakes,
oceans, and states or
countries are often represented by polygons.

Vector data has some important advantages:  

  * The geometry itself contains information about what the dataset creator thought was important  
  * The geometry structures hold information in themselves - why choose point over polygon, for instance?  
  * Each geometry feature can carry multiple attributes instead of just one, e.g. a database of cities can have attributes for name, country, population, etc  
  * Data storage can be very efficient compared to rasters  
  
The downsides of vector data are  

  * potential loss of detail compared to raster  
  * potential bias in datasets - what didn't get recorded?  
  * Calculations involving multiple vector layers need to do math on the geometry as well as the attributes, so can be slow compared to raster math  

Vector datasets are in use in many industries besides geospatial. For instance, computer
graphics are largely vector-based, although the data structures in use tend to join points using
arcs and complex curves rather than straight lines. Computer-aided design (CAD) is also vector-
based. The difference is, again, that geospatial datasets are accompanied by information tying
their features to real-world locations.

## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons
Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format.
Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each
individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon
objects in a single shapefile.

Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that
describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of
streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream "order" and other
information about each stream line object.

### Why not both?  

Very few formats can contain both raster and vector data - in fact, most are even more restrictive
than that. Vector datasets are usually locked to one geometry type, e.g. points only. Raster
datasets can usually only encode one data type, for example you can't have a multiband GeoTIFF
where one layer is integer data and another is floating-point. 

There are sound reasons for this - format standards are easier to define and maintain, and so is
metadata. The effects of particular data manipulations are more predictable if you are confident
that all of your input data has the same characteristics. Even so, some limited support for mixed
vector geometries is available in R's `sf` package, and mixed raster datatypes in `raster`. Such
objects can only be saved in R's native object storage format, RDS, and should be used with
caution. 

### Common Storage Formats
### Vector  

Many vector file formats (particularly ESRI SHP and MapInfo TAB) are really several interrelated
files on disk - one holding a table of attributes, usually in DBF format, one holding related
geometric data, and various index and header files. This can make them difficult to move around
without placing them in an archive format like zip. Despite this and several other problems, the
Shapefile (SHP) is still the most commonly used vector data format. 

GeoPackage is an SQLite database with an extended definition that allows spatial data storage. It
has the advantage of being a single file on disk, along with stronger internal rules around data
and encoding. 

XML and JSON-style formats for vector spatial data also exist, notably KML (popularised in Google
Earth) and GeoJSON. These formats are commonly used by software developers for delivering
geospatial data over web services. They have the advantage of being streamable (you don't need to
download and open a whole file, you can just access part of it), but like any plain-text format,
file size becomes very large very quickly. GeoJSON also only supports the WGS84 coordinate
reference system.
