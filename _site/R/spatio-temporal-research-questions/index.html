<h2 id="questions-start-the-research-process">Questions Start the Research Process</h2>
<p>The scientific method often begins with a question that you would like to 
answer. Once we have a question, we identify the methods needed to address that
question.
When our question is small, in temporal and/or spatial scale, we might be able
to go out and collect the data needed to answer the question ourselves. When we
ask questions that cover broad spatial and temporal scales, we often need to use
data collected by others. We will refer to these data as “external data”.</p>

<p>In this and related lesson series (see the info in the grey box above), our
question at hand explores the drivers of and observed patterns of phenology.<br />
In most temperate zones of the world, one notices that the vegetation is more
green during some times of the year and more brown during other time.</p>

<p>REMOTE SENSING IMAGE SHOWING THIS PATTERN?</p>

<p>Our specific question is therefore, what causes the pattern of phenophase timing
(when vegetation begins growth (turns green) or senesces/ dies back (turns
brown))?</p>

<p>To answer our question, we could follow the annual cycle of plant phenology at
one site and look for environmental correlates that show a similar pattern. 
That might give us a detailed picture of what happens in one location but does
it provide a good answer for what causes phenophase patterns throughout the 
temperate zones of the globe?</p>

<p>Perhaps we should add a broader spatial component to our study.  If we conduct
our research at two sites then we can see if similar environmental variables
correlate with the phenophase timing at both sites.  For our research we will
use the Harvard Forest located in the northeastern US state of Massachusetts and
the San Joaquin Experimental Range located in the southern end of the US state
of California.  These two sites are about 4,900km (3,000 miles) apart!</p>

<p>MAP OF USA w/ the two sites – do not yet link to NEON site.  We’ll “gather” that
data later.</p>

<p>Our revised research question is now, <em>What causes the pattern of phenophase</em>
<em>timing at two different sites in the US?</em> Our question now has two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <strong>temporal</strong> component – We will need data collected across time because
the timing of phenophases (when vegetation begins growth (turns green) or
senesces/ dies back (turns brown)) occurs throughout the annual cycle.</li>
  <li>a <strong>spatial</strong> component – We would like to explore this pattern across one
site and then potentially compare these patterns to those observed at another
site.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="from-scientific-question-to-research-tasks">From Scientific Question to Research Tasks</h2>
<p>We’ve stated that we want to figure out what causes the pattern of phenophase
timing at two different sites in the US. However, to tackle this question we
need to break down the question in to several discrete questions that can later
get subsetting again into research tasks. These discrete questions help us
figure out what data need to be collected.</p>

<div id="challenge">
  <h2 id="challenge-breaking-down-a-large-research-quesion">Challenge: Breaking Down a Large Research Quesion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What are some smaller questions/ tasks we need to ask to figure out our
overall question?</li>
    <li>What data do we need to collect/ gather to answer these questions?</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Here is one way to break this larger question down into smaller questions/ task.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do we measure or quantify phenology/phenophase timing at our sites,
across an annual cycle (or several annual cycles)?</li>
  <li>What ecological correlates may be related to plant growth or senescence?</li>
  <li>What is our study site like? Are there any interesting features of the site
that might affect the patterns we see?</li>
  <li>How can we create graphics (e.g., maps, figures, etc) to help explain any 
patterns that we find.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="quantify-phenophase----ndvi">Quantify Phenophase – NDVI</h2>
<p>As we said, we need to quantitatively measures phenology - the greening up and
browning down of vegetation – over a whole site.</p>

<h4 id="measuring-plant-phenology-from-ground-to-space-video">Measuring Plant Phenology from Ground to Space Video</h4>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4uHLXL1yZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As this video points out there are different ways to measure phenophases. 
Remote sensing data are valuable when we are trying to view site-wide vegetation
patterns. Specifically, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an
index that efficiently measures green-up and brown-down. NDVI is a quantitative
index of greenness ranging from 0-1 where 0 represents minimal or no greenness
and 1 represents maximum greenness.</p>

<p>NDVI is often used for a quantitative proxy measure of vegetation health, cover
and phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas.</p>

    <figcaption>NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light
    reflected by vegetation. Healthy vegetation (left) absorbs most of the
    visible light that hits it, and reflects a large portion of
    near-infrared light. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation (right) reflects more
    visible light and less near-infrared light. Image &amp; Caption Source: NASA

<h3 id="where-to-access-ndvi-data">Where to Access NDVI Data</h3>
<p>NDVI data is calculated from raster spatial data that is collected using 
satellite based sensors.</p>

<h2 id="quantify-correlates-of-phenology-temperature-daylength-precipitation-and-light">Quantify Correlates of Phenology: Temperature, Daylength, Precipitation, and Light</h2>
<p>We know from the daily weather report that temperature and precipitation are
recorded at many, many location across the globe.  We could just choose the 
closest NOAA weather station and use the temperature and precipitation data from
that.  However, the closest weather station might not be close nor experience
the same weather patterns as the research site.</p>

<p>Luckily many research stations have a local weather station, or even better, a
flux tower on site. Flux towers contain sensors that collect high frequency
(many measurements a second or minute) measurements of variables including
temperature, precipitation, different measures of the light available and more.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="data-to-describe-the-study-site">Data to Describe the Study Site</h2>
<p>We often have to conduct a significant amount of planning (for grants, permits,
etc) prior to visiting our field site.  It is thus useful to create basemaps
during initial data exploration that help us explore characteristics of our 
site.   Useful characteristics include topography, infrastructure/ landmarks
(locations and names of the buidlings, roads, streams, etc), vegetation cover
and more. As we learn more about the location, more data can be added to the
maps.  Maps are also useful for publication to both show readers where the study
area is located and to highlight important characteristics.</p>
